### 🚀 Project Overview

A comprehensive exploratory data analysis of Netflix's content library (8,807 titles till 2021) to derive **actionable strategic insights** for content acquisition, regional expansion, and audience targeting.

**Key Goals Achieved:
- Analyzed content composition (Movies vs TV Shows, genres, maturity ratings)
- Identified regional imbalances and underrepresented markets
- Uncovered evolution of content strategy (pre- vs post-2015 shift)
- Provided data-driven recommendations to improve catalog diversity and global engagement

> **Result**: Netflix's catalog is heavily skewed toward U.S. & Indian content, mature-rated titles (TV-MA), and drama/comedy genres — revealing clear opportunities for family content, regional originals, and genre diversification.

### 🎯 Conclusion

Netflix has successfully transitioned from a distributor to a global content powerhouse, but its catalog still shows **clear imbalances** — heavy reliance on U.S./Indian mature dramas. By diversifying regionally, balancing maturity ratings, and investing in underserved genres, Netflix can accelerate subscriber growth, reduce churn, and strengthen its position in emerging markets.
